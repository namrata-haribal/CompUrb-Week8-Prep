# Class Plan and Prep for Week 8, Computational Urbanism (Webscraping) 

For our Computational Urbanism Tutorial -- a fully student-led and student-designed course about theories on urbanism and ways to apply computational techniques to urbanism -- a classmate and I designed and led a session on web-scraping. You can take a look at our class plan which contains readings and the pre-class work we assigned to students as well as the activity we designed (with a suggested solution set).
